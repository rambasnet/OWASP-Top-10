xp_cmdshell Proxy Account
When it is called by a user that is not a member of the sysadmin fixed server role, 
xp_cmdshell connects to Windows by using the account name and password stored in 
the credential named ##xp_cmdshell_proxy_account##. 
If this proxy credential does not exist, xp_cmdshell will fail.

The proxy account credential can be created by executing sp_xp_cmdshell_proxy_account. 
As arguments, this stored procedure takes a Windows user name and password. 
For example, the following command creates a proxy credential for Windows domain user SHIPPING\KobeR that has the Windows password sdfh%dkc93vcMt0.

EXEC sp_xp_cmdshell_proxy_account 'SHIPPING\KobeR','sdfh%dkc93vcMt0'
