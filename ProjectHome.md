The project consists of training materials in C# and VB.NET covering OWASP and related Top 25 most dangerous Programming Errors.

The project is targeted towards .net web application developers to give them hands-on experience on the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities plus other most common and dangerous programming errors.

1. The Project consists of three sample web applications:
a) Banking
b) E-commerce
c) Malicious
and corresponding mssql databases. Together with these sites running concurrently, developers can see live actions of XSS and CSRF (which are a little complicated to conceptualize)!

2. Banking and E-commerce sites have both C# and VB.Net implementations.

3. The applications can be easily run using MS Visual Studio Express Editions.

3. The applications can help developers become familiar with good and bad coding practices in terms of security.

4. The project can be a very effective and facilitative tool for training and presentation sessions.
